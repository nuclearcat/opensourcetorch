Opensource programmable... torch? light? flashlight? I dont know, but it is funny and i like it.

We have onboard:
3xRGB(parallel) light, indicator light, accelerometer, illumination sensor, USB-Serial (CH340) for debug, lithium battery charger.

Example applications: coming soon

Read ERRATA first, if you want to make your own!
